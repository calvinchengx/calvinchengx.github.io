a16z wrote a [well thought out piece](https://future.a16z.com/web3-decentralization-models-framework-principles-how-to/) expressing the why and the promise of web3 as a design challenge requiring strong foundations in 3 aspects

* technical decentralization
* economic decentralization
* legal decentralization

It's a great read and I can definitely identify with it in relation to my own experiences working with a range of crypto-native, web3 companies.

Having worked in a diverse range of companies - from a hardware/manufacturing company in my very first real job and transiting through a range of software-centric, web 1.0 and web 2.0 companies - I have experienced how different the leadership's mindsets are across this entire spectrum of operating models.

## Modern Industrialization and Manufacturing

Manufacturing in the 2000s is all about management command-and-control, operational efficiency and cost control. This model has a long history from nineteenth-century industrialists. Peter Drucker (1909-2005) taught that management is a liberal art and infused his management advice with interdisciplinary lessons from history, sociology, psychology, philosophy, culture and religion. Drucker's approach worked well in the increasingly mature business world of the second half of the twentieth century where large corporations have developed basic manufacturing efficiencies and managerial hierachies of mass production.

But Drucker was ahead of his time. He is also intrigued by employees who knew more about certain subjects than their bosses or colleagues, and yet had to collaborate with others in a large organization. Drucker challenged the common thinking about how organizations should be run and took it upon himself to poke holes in their beliefs, hoping to challenge organizations to evolve beyond their assumptions.

Drucker's writings have predicted many of the major developments in the past 30 years, including privatization and decentralization; the rise of Japan, the decisive importance of marketing and the emergence of knowledge work that necessitates lifelong learning.

## Dot Com Boom-and-Crash and Web 2.0

However, Drucker did not fully understand the economic significance of the internet. In an interview with Erick Shonfeld, while Drucker believes that the cultural impact of the Internet is ["unbelievably great" and has tremendous importance, it is only "marginal \[economic\] size"](https://boards.fool.com/drucker-the-internet-more-buffett-or-barrett-19648461.aspx?sort=whole).

Almost 20 years later, with the benefit of hindsight, we now know that the companies with the biggest market capitalization in the world are mostly [internet companies - from Apple, to Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta](https://www.investopedia.com/biggest-companies-in-the-world-by-market-cap-5212784).

An entire different way of thinking and operating has emerged over the past two decades where how-fast-you-learn and how-fast-companies-execute and knowledge work give the competitive edge over industrial-age corporate hierarchies.
